SA6MWA Amateur Radio Operator Logs.

I have stopped using online logbook services since 2019. This is where I keep
my public QSO logs and those of other stations/callsigns that I'm activating.
Previous logs are available on my (outdated)
[qrz.com page](https://www.qrz.com/DB/SA6MWA).

Most files are [ADIF logs](http://www.adif.org/adif.html) unless a
contest/activity requires a different logging format. I have chosen to separate
the logs in different files per activity or session. For the ADIF logs you can
run adifaggregator.py to generate a complete list of my QSOs in a single ADIF.
